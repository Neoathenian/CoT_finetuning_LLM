# Project Goal
Create training data for an LLM, where each question is answered using a detailed chain-of-thought reasoning process.
The inspiration for this is David ShapiroÂ´s open-source project https://github.com/daveshap/Raspberry and youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZfzo4SrPIs.

# Plan of Action

1. Connect an LLM to the GPU.
2. Generate questions.
3. Answer the questions using chain-of-thought reasoning.
4. Clean and format the answers to reflect a clear thought process.
